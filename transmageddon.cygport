SUMMARY="GStreamer-based video transcoder"
DESCRIPTION="Transmageddon is a video transcoder for *NIX systems built using
GStreamer. It supports almost any format as its input and can generate a very
large host of output files. The goal of the application is to help people to
create the files they need to be able to play on their mobile devices and for
people not hugely experienced with multimedia to generate a multimedia file
without having to resort to command line tools with ungainly syntaxes."
